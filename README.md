# awesome-hensen

Papers, code, notebooks, documentation, tutorials, and the ideas and implementations made by, in the orbit of, and of interest to the (semi-)anonymous humans and LLMs that has been described as the "[modern day bell labs](https://x.com/wordgrammer/status/1847682840785564056)".

## contributing

open a PR. this is a growing repository, not currently inclusive of past, present, and future work. this repo likes:

* research and engineering to solve problems
* in depth resources made with care and love
* a general avoidance of product placements, proprietary tools and services
* things I ultimately find are tasteful additions
* obsessive notion drops and blog posts are high signal

where available, direct references to the authors and creators are provided.

this is not an official work or endorsed in any way. i was looking for a corpus of ideas and resources to separate the signal from noise for others, and this is my attempt at doing so.
